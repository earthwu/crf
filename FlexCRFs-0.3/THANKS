We would like to thank professor Jorge Nocedal, Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering, School of Engineering and Applied Science, Northwestern University, for
providing L-BFGS FORTRAN source code. www.ece.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/

The C version of L-BFGS used in this project is borrowed from CRF++ project developed by
Taku Kudo (www.chasen.org/~taku/software/CRF++/). We would like to thank him for his open
source project.

A part of this project, the training section (e.g., the computation of log-likelihood
function and its gradient vector), is based on the Java source code of CRF project developed
by professor Sunita Sarawagi, KR School of Information Technology, IIT Bombay. We would like
to thank prof. Sunita Sarawagi for sharing the CRF package and answering related questions.
